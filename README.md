### Abstract

Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science whose goal is to automate activities that presently require human intelligence. Recent successes involve improvements in automatic text generation, facial and speech recognition, detecting motion gestures, drug discovery and quantum supremacy. 
AI-powered solutions are used by dozens of companies and implemented in different fields, changing a lot of industries and reshaping the landscape of health, learning, daily living. IT is a  revolutionary technology which the communication industry is exploring, in order to introduce it to the communication field, and to improve the user experience and networks efficiency by providing new services. The FINE framework is a contender in the steps to find a better solution for the network systems, which can be illustrated by the example of an SDN/NFV.

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or Computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. Most AI projects that you hear about today from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using AI technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.
