## Abstract

Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science whose goal is to automate activities that presently require human intelligence. Recent successes involve improvements in automatic text generation, facial and speech recognition, detecting motion gestures, drug discovery and quantum supremacy. 
AI-powered solutions are used by dozens of companies and implemented in different fields, changing a lot of industries and reshaping the landscape of health, learning, daily living. IT is a  revolutionary technology which the communication industry is exploring, in order to introduce it to the communication field, and to improve the user experience and networks efficiency by providing new services. The FINE framework is a contender in the steps to find a better solution for the network systems, which can be illustrated by the example of an SDN/NFV.

# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or Computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. Most AI projects that you hear about today from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using AI technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming rapidly present in all aspects of everyday life. It affects everyone, and its capabilities are volving extremely fast. Artificial intelligence exists since 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks to the big ideas coming in waves. In 2016, the win of the Go match by AlphaGo against Lee Sedol has attracted a lot of attention to AI. Communication is a sector playing a key role in any business or organization, and it deals with a variety of consumer demands specially in multimedia services. Due to AI, software-defined networks (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) exist and the intellectualization of communication networks and services are becoming possible.

## Advantages of AI

Artificial intelligence continues to make a huge difference in the communication industry. Similar to all the companies, Communication companies hope to take advantage of AI. We can see the appearance of the chatbots powered by AI that is used to automate communication. They are used in many ways to engage with customers, such as answering questions or providing shopping assistance and communicating with clients. Let us look at some of the advantages in the next few subsections.

## Ability to learn

AI is already used in multiple disciplines and industries. These devices are capable of reading, writing, speaking and understanding. Unlike humans, AI has computational power that allows it to process copious amounts of data. As AI’s tasks continue to become more advanced, there’s also an increase in computational power necessary—which can become expensive. In order to avoid this need, AI was made to be a specific purpose learner. Operators need intelligent decisions to manage the dynamic traffic, deep learning can be used to solve this problem. As a conclusion AI can learn how to operate, manage and maintain networks.

## Ability of collaboration

Due to the increasing number of users and to the expansion of the network in size, 
the structure complexity to build and maintain a network has increased too. To collaborate and manage the nodes, we find a new technology, a multi-agent collaboration, of distributed AI into the network management.
